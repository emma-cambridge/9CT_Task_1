# 9CT Assessment Task
By Emma Cambridge  
## Requirements Outline
I need to create a program for my EV3 robot that allows it to move two blocks to the start zone and dodge two other blocks using two sensors. The program will need to:
- Object Detection: The robot must stop when an object is detected within 10cm
    - Use Case: The robot is navigating and encounters an object. The ultrasonic sensor detects the object within 10cm. The robot stops moving forward. The robot stops 10cm away from the object.
- Check Colour: The robot must use the colour sensor to check whether the object is blue or green, or red or yellow.
    - Use Case: 
- Capture the Object: If the colour is detected as yellow or red then the robot must use a skewer attachment to grab the object.
- Drag the Object: After capturing the object the robot must turn 180 degrees and return to the start zone.
